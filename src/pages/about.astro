      I'm passionate about solving real problems in elegant ways. Over the years, I've learned that simple is hard - it takes experience and discipline to resist complexity and find the straightforward solution. I believe the best approach is often to solve problems without writing code at all, as every line of code brings maintenance burden and potential for bugs. My focus is on finding pragmatic solutions that deliver value while remaining maintainable and sustainable for the long term.
